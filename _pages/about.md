I am a One Health practitioner focused on addressing challenges at the human-animal-environment interface. I specifically work with pastoralists in the drylands of East Africa on issues surrounding human and animal health, livelihoods, and climate change resilience. I received my DVM, MPH, and MS in Conservation Medicine from Tufts University. I am developing and validating a One Health cost-effectiveness tool (OHCET) for my PhD that can be used for the rapid economic assessment of One Health initiatives. When I'm not on my computer or in the field, I enjoy hiking with my wife, two dogs, and (leashed) cat in Central Massachusetts.

Our CABI One Health Case Study titled: "One Health in Turkana County, Kenya: Applications and Lessons Learned," has been accepted for publication and is undergoing the final editing process. It examines the development and application of One Health policy in Turkana. Keep an eye out for that!
